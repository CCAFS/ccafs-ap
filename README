What is the CCAFS Planning and Reporting Platform?

The CCAFS Planning and Reporting system (P&R) is a platform to assist in the planning and reporting of CCAFS-related research activities. In addition to serving as the principal avenue for Theme Leaders, Regional Program Leaders, Contact Points, the Coordinating Unit and Center Principal Investigators to submit and review yearly activity plans and reports, it is also a repository for all CCAFS activities from 2010 onwards.
