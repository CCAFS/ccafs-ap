The way we hope to influence these organisations is to invite them to participate (and/or fund) some social learning activities serving a larger interest, and to bring them in the middle of our reflection process to get them to experience social learning first hand. The sandbox complements the evidence-gathering work that is another part of the CCSL work plan for the years to come.\r\n\r\nIn order to pave the way for this vision to happen, in 2015 we hope to rally other networks and organisations working on similar ideas as social learning, so as to develop a strong alliance that connects a wider part of the development community (and potentially join their initiatives that complement our work).

The yet prevailing technocratic approach to food system has largely ignored the human dimension. However, technical innovations may have major consequences for the social fabric of communities, access to resources and power constellations. The proposed activity will help understanding such consequences and highlight requirements for good governance in transformation processes.','The activity will provide insights, identify requirements and knowledge gaps on how governance can contribute to reduce gender and social inequalities in sustainability transformation and build capacity of marginalized groups to deal with climate change impacts.','The overall goal of this research stream is to identify pathways for transformation in governance towards sustainable food systems that are resilient towards shocks and surprises in general, and towards climate change in particular.\r\nWe argue that sustainable food systems should be resilient. Resilience can be defined as:  “Resilience is the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks”. (Walker et al, 2004).  Resilience is a system characteristic which does not only apply to climate change and associated unexpected developments, shocks and surprises. Resilience food systems will also be resilient towards climate change. Some system characteristics may be of general nature such as polycentricity, respect of good governance principles, modularity, diversity. Other characteristics may be more specific taking into account expected threats from climate change.  Most food systems are not resilient and major structural transformations may be required. We focus on structural transformation the governance system since we consider this to be at the core of determining and sustaining resilient food systems. \r\nA transformation in a governance system can be defined as structural change in several interdependent system components (e.g. institutions, configuration of actor networks) and change in the overall system logic, in dominant cultural cognitive institutions.  Transformative capacity refers then to the ability of a governance system to first adapt and if required transform structural elements as response to experienced or expected changes in the societal or natural environment. Transformations may be fluent though and there may be considerable overlap since adaptation may be a first step towards transformation. Furthermore it is also not straightforward to operationalize how to identify what may be called transformative change – not in hindsight but once the transformation occurs.\r\nThe dynamics of systemic transformations are not well understood. Furthermore it is controversial to which extent such transformations can be governed. \r\nHence our initiative will address both transformations in governance systems towards increased resilience and governance of transformations. The questions to be addressed include:\r\n•	What are the characteristics of governance systems that make food systems more sustainable and resilient and to which extent are those characteristics context specific?\r\n•	Which kind of transformative change in governance is required to move towards sustainable and resilient food systems? \r\n•	To which extent can and should such transformative change be governed, how, at which scale and by whom? \r\nThe first question refers to the kind of governance of food systems one should aim for (e.g. polycentric, diverse scales).  Work on this question is closely linked to issues addressed in the working group on “Effective governance mechanisms, indicators and cross-scale linkages for climate resilient food systems”. Exchange and cooperation with the other working group will be sought during the implementation of these activities. \r\nThe second and the third questions focus on the process of transformative change and embrace issues as: how can change be initiated, monitored and sustained, whose change is it. \r\nA technocratic approach would assume that one can develop a kind of blue-print on what would be the desirable characteristics of a sustainable and climate resilient food system.  After the identification of deficits of the current system and measures how to overcome them, the major governance task would be to convincingly communicate this knowledge and mobilize appropriate resources for the implementation of change.\r\nHowever, experience has proven that simplistic panaceas do not work. Context and history have to be taken into account. Furthermore, one cannot assume that there might be overall agreement on requirements and direction of change. Transformative change has to be portrayed as an evolutionary process embracing both purposeful design self-organization, instances of social learning, conflict and negotiation. Hence it will be important to identify the structural factors (e.g. formal and informal institutions, power constellations, resource distribution) stabilizing the current food system and potential points of leverage.

Such coordinated studies would allow analysing and comparing transformative change. The approach could support learning within and between the cases. It would develop insights and policy guidance on how transformation could/should work/occur. This would be a long-term project over 5 to 10 years. Such first ideas will be substantiated and revised during the scoping phase. \r\n\r\nScoping Phase:\r\nThe scoping phase would develop the knowledge base and establish the network for a long term research project. The major activities of the scoping phase would include:\r\n•	Development of a conceptual framework on transformation which will include global, national and local/regional levels. Such development will address as well normative indicators on both process and progress. This is to guide analysis and be improved by exploratory assessment, as well as through involving people “on the ground.” \r\n•	Identification of indicators to guide and understand and define transformation.\r\n•	Testing of the framework in an exploratory historical case study (yet to be decided – possibly green revolution or EU agricultural policy) to identify drivers of change and factors providing obstacles and those facilitating transformation, normative criteria to assess implications of such change. \r\n•	Identification of criteria and potential candidates for interesting case studies for a long-term research project. \r\n\r\nIssues to be addressed in the scoping phase include:  \r\nWhat’s a change and what is transformative? How do you know if a transformative change has happened? Was it intentional? Which kind of transformative change is desirable and who should decide on the direction of change? \r\nWhat is the role of the different levels global – national – local and of cross-level linkages? \r\nWhat is the role for disasters (e.g. devastating droughts of floods) to open up space for new ideas which could lead to transformative change?\r\nTo which extent can and should the direction of change be determined and serve as guiding target?

Particular discourses stick because they create images (such as the concept of ‘green revolution’) that articulate actors’ interests, and can change policy and governance by bringing together powerful constellations of actors.

In fact, the information derived from interaction with stakeholders feeds iteratively into the model as the modeling exercise progresses through the various development phases.However, the interaction among agricultural practices and landscape components is very location and condition specific and therefore location- and condition- specific policies and programs are needed to promote the effective governance required for spatially-targeted investments toward climate-smart objectives. Without the mechanisms that incentivize and facilitate the positive interaction among landscape components, the positive output of a few standard-compliant farms may be insufficient to achieve large mitigation goals.

Improved agricultural practices, although targeted at food security and resilience to climate change, may not be attractive without systematic and scientific basis that addresses actual biophysical or socio-economic constraints to improved agricultural productivity. Evidence further highlights that adaptation practices need to be site-specific, tailored according to environmental conditions and with regard to available livelihood options (Kristjanson et al., 2012). In Tanzania, the lack of such framework and system, including knowledge of soil and land health indicators, limits the utility and application of results from crop suitability models and bio-economic models for current and future climate scenarios, especially at the farm scale.

Beyond these broader reforms, lie specific mitigation policies like ‘agricultural offsets’  which provide a mechanism by which sectors facing higher marginal abatement costs can tap low cost mitigation opportunities within agriculture. In some instances, realizing mitigation opportunities within agriculture may also offer potential to further enhance existing Indian programs and policies aimed at increasing agricultural productivity and improving the sustainability of India’s farming systems.

After four years, it appears that successful results and lessons learnt from ground experimentation could be considered for scaling up. In this regard, we trained representatives of 30  (15 by site) rural community radios on understanding climate information and its jargon in order to ensure a widespread dissemination and use of the seasonal forecast information by farmers. In view of the great interest of the URAC and the estimated 2 million farmers reached through this initial experience, we now would like to strengthen the partnership in a way to cover the whole country with this innovative and sound communication approach.  \r\n\r\nAlso, during 2013, ANACIM and CCAFS used the tested protocole within Kaffrine in three different regions in Senegal: Thies, Louga and Diourbel. In Louga, the Millenium Development Goal project did fund half of the activities costs. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this proposal is to upscale the climate smart agriculture communication approach developed in Kaffrine to reach wider communities in Senegal. This will be done through the following specific objectives:  \r\n1)	Consolidate the finding on risk management interventions in the sites of Kaffrine, Thies, Louga and Diourbel during recent years through co-production of climate information products and tools with farmers;\r\n2)	Train the network of rural radio communicators to understand and be able to communicate seasonal and intra-seasonal forecast information to farmers communities; this will also include the documentation of indigenous knowledge on climate forecast by farmers in each site and,','2015-01-01','2015-12-31',0,NULL,306,'We expect that through the URAC channel, more women farmers will access and utilize climate information and advisory services.
