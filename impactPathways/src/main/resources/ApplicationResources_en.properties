# Glossary Content
home.glossary.activities=Activities
home.glossary.activities.definition=We consider size 250K USD multi-year activities.  We need to ensure that we are capturing also activities that are smaller than that, but yet key in achieving the set outcomes.  Therefore, we need to enfold them as an activity within your project larger activities.  Activities like this will be led by an <b>Activity Leader</b>.
home.glossary.adoption=Adoption
home.glossary.adoption.definition=In research in development impact pathways, adoption refers to the primary and direct use of the research output by beneficiaries. This use may lead to changes; i.e. outcomes and impacts.

home.glossary.budget=CCAFS Budget 
home.glossary.budget.definition=Is what is put forth through CCAFS and covers Window 1 (W1), Window 2 (W2), Window 3 (W3) and bilaterally raised funds by CGIAR centers, excluding leveraged funds from non-CG partners.
home.glossary.budget.definition.w1=<b>W1</b>: Funds to support the entire CGIAR program portfolio including through CRPs as well as to proposals from the consortium for support to other critical activities that are vital for successful implementation of the strategy and results framework.
home.glossary.budget.definition.w2=<b>W2</b>: Funds designated to one or more of the CRPs
home.glossary.budget.definition.w3=<b>W3</b>: Donor funds specifically earmarked to a CRP through a center
home.glossary.budget.definition.bilateral=<b>Bilateral</b>: Funds raised directly by CGIAR Centers through concepts notes and proposals. Centers decide to which CRP they want to map their bilateral and not the donor who decides.
home.glossary.budget.definition.leveraged=<b>Leveraged</b>: TBD
home.glossary.budget.definition.activity=<b>Activity Budget</b>: TBD
home.glossary.deliverables=Deliverables
home.glossary.deliverables.definition= We are using the term synonymously with outputs.  A deliverable can be a small unit, a thing, a workshop, a paper, a scenario, etc. Several deliverables are part of an output group.
home.glossary.endUsers=End Users
home.glossary.endUsers.definition=Are the beneficiary population, usually quite massive, making it unfeasible for a project or program to work with them directly.
home.glossary.evidence=Evidence
home.glossary.evidence.definition=Is the information presented to support a finding or conclusion. Such evidence should be sufficient, competent and relevant. There are several sources for evidence: observations (obtained through direct observation of people or events); documentary (obtained from written information); analytical (based on computations and comparisons); self-reported (obtained through, for example, surveys) and experiential (based on professions understanding and expertise that is accumulated over time).
home.glossary.impact=Impact
home.glossary.impact.definition=Is the change in welfare of end-users (or beneficiaries), mostly farmer communities and others, as in the case of environmental impacts in the long-term (20, 50, 100 years), resulting from a chain of events to which research has contributed, directly or indirectly, intended or unintended.
home.glossary.impactPathway=Impact Pathways (IPs)
home.glossary.impactPathway.definition=Describe results chains, showing the linkages between the sequence of results in getting to impact (including assumptions underpinning the causal chain); causal pathways for research project or program that outlines the expected sequence to achieve desired objectives beginning with inputs, moving through activities and outputs, and culminating in outcomes and impacts.
home.glossary.indicator=Indicator
home.glossary.indicator.definition=A quantitative or qualitative variable that represents an approximation of the characteristics, phenomenon or change of interest (e.g. efficiency, quality or outcome). Indicators can be used to monitor outcome and progress or to help assess for instance organisational or research performance.
home.glossary.ido=Intermediate Development Outcome (IDO)
home.glossary.ido.definition=Targets are CRP level representing CRP specific target domains that are generated as a result of multiple activities by diverse actors outside CGIAR. Their scales reflect CRP target domain and estimated volume of benefits.
home.glossary.mog=Major Output Groups (MOGs)
home.glossary.mog.definition=The large groups of outputs, products and deliverables (e.g. new knowledge from research together with new capacity in a specific group of stakeholders to use that knowledge and enact CSA policy) that are necessary for achieving an outcome.
home.glossary.managementLiason=Management Liaison
home.glossary.managementLiason.definition=Is the person who controls the budget for the project, they are responsible for it from the programmatic, either regional, flagship or CU portfolio perspective and will be the ones that 1) pre-fill a) their respective portfolio plans (impact pathways, with indicator and targets), b) the (contractual) project details and 2) will coordinate feedback to the projects at the various stages (e.g. planning, reporting) and 3) they will be the ones who need to summarize and synthesize from what they get reported from the projects.
home.glossary.nextUsers=Next Users
home.glossary.nextUsers.definition=Are actors such as national research institutions, extension organizations, NGOs and others, which access CG products directly. Next users can create an environment that enables the target impact for end-users; decision makers that we want to influence to achieve outcomes.
home.glossary.outcome=Outcome
home.glossary.outcome.definition=The changes in next-users that need to happen so that an enabling environment is created and the targeted impact can occur.  These are medium-term practice changes that occur through the adoption, use or influence of the research product by the next-users, who end up doing things in different ways. These practice changes are underpinned by the related necessary changes in knowledge, attitudes and/or skills.  What do next-users need to <b>DO</b> to contribute to the enabling environment needed for achieving the targeted impact?  In CCAFS we have 2 levels of outcomes, with 2019 outcomes shared between regions and flagships contributing to 2025 outcomes.  The timestamp on the outcome represents the year by which CCAFS anticipates meeting the related outcome target in each flagship.
home.glossary.outcomestatement=Outcome Statement, see Project Outcome Statement
home.glossary.outcomestory=Outcome Story: see Project Outcome Story
home.glossary.outputs=Outputs
home.glossary.outputs.definition=(used synonymously with the term deliverables) Can be research findings, insights, experience, problems solved, etc., resulting from research and measured by achievement of deliverable and process indicators.
home.glossary.partners=Partners
home.glossary.partners.definition1=Can be individuals and organizations that we work with to generate our outputs and products and to interact with next-users.
home.glossary.partners.definition2=Expertise, network and influence with next-users.
home.glossary.partners.definition3=Implementers.
home.glossary.partners.definition4=These can be  1) budget receiving partner to lead an activity or  2) budget receiving partner contributing to implementation of parts of an activity  or  3) only leverage funding providing implementation partners  or  4) a combination of any of the three afore mentioned.
home.glossary.project=Project
home.glossary.project.definition=The individual projects of research of development that contribute to a major research action. Each Flagship is made up of multiple projects, which in turn may be made up of multiple activities.
home.glossary.projectLeader=Project Leader
home.glossary.projectLeader.definition=Is the person in the lead and coordinating role for the project. S/he is responsible for the ultimate delivery of the project and the coordination with the project partners as well as the contact person for the management liaison.
home.glossary.projectOutcome=Project Outcome (Statement)
home.glossary.projectOutcome.definition=Describes \u2018who (exactly) is doing what (exactly) in a specific way (and often in a different way from before)\u2019 to achieve our set goals. (see image: <a href="http://screencast.com/t/RsKgyrbzMl" target="_blank">http://screencast.com/t/RsKgyrbzMl</a>)
home.glossary.projectOutcome.story=Project Outcome Story
home.glossary.projectOutcome.story.definition=We are asking at the planning stage for you to anticipate any story that gives evidence of your project activities contributing to some behavioral changes in the coming year.  This is just a guess and you might identify a different story at the reporting stage, but we have found it useful for the projects to aim for these stories as it helped project teams to be more aware of looking out for these kind of stories to report.
home.glossary.projectPartner=Project Partners
home.glossary.projectPartner.definition=Are other contributing organizations and nominated people within these organizations.
home.glossary.resultsBaseManagement=Results-Based Management
home.glossary.resultsBaseManagement.definition=Management strategy focusing on performance and achievement of outputs, outcomes, and impacts.
home.glossary.targetvalue=Target Value
home.glossary.targetvalue.definition=Is the number that your project or region is contributing towards a selected indicator.  The target value has the format of a number only, as the indicators wordings have been standardized.  E.g. Outcome indicators from Flagship 1:  # of national and subnational development initiatives and public institutions prioritize and inform project implementation of equitable best bet CSA options using CCAFS science and decision support tools.  <b>Target value FP1 for 2019</b>: 15 (in at least 10 countries). Target value contribution LAM 2019: 4 (Colombia, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua).  When it comes to unpacking the target values and break them down by years, we have agreed that this would be accumulative.  E.g. Target value FP1 2015: 2 and 2016: 4 (this means that each year 2 initiatives have started using CCAFS support tools).
home.glossary.targetnarrative=Target narrative
home.glossary.targetnarrative.definition=Is the explanation that we will need to ensure that we understand your target value contribution towards the indicator and that we are when aggregating these numbers. See example above (\u2018in at least 10 countries) and (Colombia, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua), would be some narrative explaining the target value. 
home.glossary.toc=Theory of Change (ToC)
home.glossary.toc.definition=Complements impact pathways by describing the causal linkages through which it is expected that an intervention will bring about the desired results. Theory of Change is expressed as a causal model or a series of hypotheses of how the intervention worked or is expected to work.
